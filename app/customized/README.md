## Custom
This directory is specifically for customizations, (overriding, inheritance)
of third-party, open source code.

For example, Wtforms, a widely used python library does not offer support for
the html5 multiple file input.

SQLalchemy's objects for example, do not offer a way to serialize to JSON
